VBA Macro which makes a publishing plan from a spreadsheet with article data

Example file included, macro is included in the example file, no need to add it. 

For testing, delete data from sheet 2, sheet 3 and sheet 4 except the header (upmost row), and leave
also one (any) keyword to first column of second row of sheet 3. 

Leave  sheet 1 intact as it is used to generalte data in sheets 2, 3 and 4. 

Data is partially in Finnish and partially in English, but you'll get the idea.
